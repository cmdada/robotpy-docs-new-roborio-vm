Robot Code Frameworks
=====================

After creating code for a few robots, you'll notice that there are a lot of
similarities between the code. Robot code frameworks are a collection of 
patterns and ideas that are generally useful for creating robot code.

While frameworks sometimes have a learning curve associated with them, once you
learn how they work you will find that they can save you a lot of effort and
prevent you from making certain kinds of mistakes.
