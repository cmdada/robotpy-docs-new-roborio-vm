RobotPy Components
==================

RobotPy provides a meta installation package that makes it simpler to install
and upgrade RobotPy. The meta package allows you to run ``pip install robotpy``
and this install all of the core RobotPy packages. This meta package is used
both for installation on your computer and on your robot.

Optional/Vendor Components
--------------------------

If you install just the ``robotpy`` package via pip, then all of the core 
RobotPy wrappers around WPILib will be installed. However there are several
groups of optional components that you can install. 
Vendor categories:

* ``navx`` - Kauai Labs NavX MXP Robotics Navigation 
* ``pathplannerlib`` - PathPlannerLib path planning vendor library
* ``phoenix5`` - CTRE Phoenix v5
* ``phoenix6`` - CTRE Phoenix v6
* ``playingwithfusion`` - Playing With Fusion vendor library
* ``rev`` - REV Robotics motor controllers and color sensors

Optional WPILib component categories:

* ``apriltag`` - WPILib apriltag library 
* ``commands2`` - WPILib Commands framework v2 (2020+)
* ``cscore`` - WPILib cscore library
* ``romi`` - Romi robot specific components
* ``sim`` - WPILib extra simulation support

Install all vendors and WPILib optional components:

* ``all``

Using components
----------------

Component categories are represented as 'extra requirements' for the RobotPy
package. Pip allows you to install extra requirements by putting the names
of the categories in brackets.

Let's say that you wanted to install the latest version of the NavX software
along with command based programming. You would do this

.. tab:: Windows

   .. code-block:: sh

      py -3 -m pip install -U robotpy[navx,commands]

.. tab:: Linux/macOS

   .. code-block:: sh

      pip3 install -U robotpy[navx,commands]

.. tab:: Linux ARM Coprocessor

   .. code-block:: sh

      pip3 install --find-links=https://tortall.net/~robotpy/wheels/2023/raspbian/ -U robotpy[navx,commands]

Or if you wanted to install everything:

.. tab:: Windows

   .. code-block:: sh

      py -3 -m pip install -U robotpy[all]

.. tab:: Linux/macOS

   .. code-block:: sh

      pip3 install -U robotpy[all]

.. tab:: Linux ARM Coprocessor

   .. code-block:: sh

      pip3 install --find-links=https://tortall.net/~robotpy/wheels/2023/raspbian/ -U robotpy[all]


RoboRIO vs Computer
-------------------

The RobotPy meta package is used for installation on both the RoboRIO and
on your computer.
